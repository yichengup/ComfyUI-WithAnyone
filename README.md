# ComfyUI-WithAnyone

This repository is a **ComfyUI port** of the **WithAnyone** model introduced in the paper  
> [WithAnyone: Towards Controllable and ID-Consistent Image Generation (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14975)

Original implementation: [Doby-Xu/WithAnyone](https://github.com/Doby-Xu/WithAnyone).  
Huge thanks and congratulations to the authors for their excellent work and for releasing it as open source.

## 📦 Model Setup

### 1. Text Encoder Models

Go to `ComfyUI/models/clip` and download the following:

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/resolve/main/clip_l.safetensors
wget https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/resolve/main/t5xxl_fp16.safetensors
```

### 2. Diffusion Models

Go to `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models` and download:

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/bstungnguyen/Flux/resolve/main/flux1-dev.safetensors
wget https://huggingface.co/WithAnyone/WithAnyone/resolve/main/withanyone.safetensors
```

### 3. VAE Model

Go to `ComfyUI/models/vae` and download:

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/bstungnguyen/Flux/resolve/main/vae/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors
```

### 4. SigLIP Model

Go to `ComfyUI/models/diffusers` and download the multilingual SigLIP model:

```bash
apt update
apt install git-lfs -y
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-base-patch16-256-multilingual
```

## ⚠️ Important Note

The `WithAnyone Model Loader` will automatically download the **ArcFace** model into  
`ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-WithAnyone/models/`.

However, there is a known issue:  
If you encounter an error such as:

```
assert 'detection' in self.models
```

please manually move the downloaded model directory to the correct location under the path above.

## 🚧 TODO

- Currently, this ComfyUI version only supports **single-person** image generation,  
  while the original WithAnyone model supports **multi-person** scenarios.
- **Flux Kontext** model support has not yet been tested.
